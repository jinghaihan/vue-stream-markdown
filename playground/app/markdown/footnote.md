> "Knowledge is power—but digital knowledge is acceleration."[^1]

For example, scanned historical texts can be preserved indefinitely and made searchable through optical character recognition (OCR).[^2]

The digital acceleration of research allows for faster peer review, near‑instant replication studies, and rapid dissemination of results. In fields like genomics and climate science, the volume of data would be overwhelming without digital tools.[^3]

The collection and use of personal data raise important questions about consent, transparency, and oversight. As AI systems increasingly shape the consumption and generation of digital knowledge, ethical governance becomes crucial.[^4]
